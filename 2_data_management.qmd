# Which Storage Should I Use?

Consult the following link (cred. Dr. Beth H.):\
<https://researchit.illinois.edu/resources/topics/backup-and-storage/data-finder>

## Example: Michael's Workflow

I find using a combination of Box and OneDrive efficient. OneDrive (seemingly) handles syncing high(er) frequency changes to files better than does Box. So all document editing, coding, producing tables and graphs, etc. are done in OneDrive and the files and folders in OneDrive are periodically 

## Desktop Apps for Box and OneDrive

### Example

When using programming or statistical software,

## File Format

### CSV (Comma-separated values) vs. xlsx (Excel)

Many administrative data (e.g. CPS) are also provided in .sav (SPSS), .dta (Stata), .sas7bdat (SAS).

|                             |   CSV   | XSLX  |
|-----------------------------|:-------:|:-----:|
| Size                        | Small\* | Big\* |
| Processing Speed            |  Fast   | Slow  |
| Multiple Sheets             |   No    |  Yes  |
| Formatting (Colors, etc)    |   No    |  Yes  |
| Analysis (Fns, graphs, etc) | No\*\*  |  Yes  |

::: {style="font-size: 12px;"}
notes: \* For larger raw data, csv may be bigger, but still processed at a faster speed. Â \*\* When csv files are open in MS Excel, functions and graphs can be made but they are not saved unless the file is converted to xlsx
:::

For instance, using R, exporting data (115,112 x 179 dimension) in either csv or xlsx format to a OneDrive folder and a Box folder consumed the following time (s):

|          |  CSV  | XSLX  |
|----------|:-----:|:-----:|
| OneDrive | 12.82 | 26.40 |
| Box      | 16.03 | 30.52 |
