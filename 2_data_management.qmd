# Which Storage Should I Use?

-   Consult the following link (cred. Dr. Beth H.):\
    <https://researchit.illinois.edu/resources/topics/backup-and-storage/data-finder>

## Example: Michael's Workflow

-   I find using a combination of Box and OneDrive efficient. Below I will explain how I use each.
    -   I strongly recommend downloading the Box and OneDrive desktop clients.
        -   <https://www.box.com/resources/downloads>
        -   <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/onedrive-desktop-app-for-windows-579d71c9-fbdd-4d6a-80ba-d0fac3920aac>

### Box

-   While OneDrive is anecdotally now FERPA approved, it is not per <https://researchit.illinois.edu/resources/topics/backup-and-storage/data-finder>.
-   Therefore I currently store data, especially with identifiable information, in Box.
-   Documents (reports, codebook, etc), tables, graphs, etc in Box are static in the sense that I never make direct changes to them.

### OneDrive

-   OneDrive (seemingly) handles syncing changes to files at a higher frequency better than does Box.
    -   Collaboration (e.g. editing MS Word document simultaneously with collaborators) is also easier on OneDrive.
-   So all document editing, coding, producing tables and graphs, etc. are done in OneDrive.
-   Files and folders in OneDrive are periodically copied to Box.

## File Format

### CSV (Comma-separated values) vs. xlsx (Excel)

Many administrative data (e.g. CPS) are also provided in .sav (SPSS), .dta (Stata), .sas7bdat (SAS).

|                             |   CSV   | XSLX  |
|-----------------------------|:-------:|:-----:|
| Size                        | Small\* | Big\* |
| Processing Speed            |  Fast   | Slow  |
| Multiple Sheets             |   No    |  Yes  |
| Formatting (Colors, etc)    |   No    |  Yes  |
| Analysis (Fns, graphs, etc) | No\*\*  |  Yes  |

notes: \* For larger raw data, csv may be bigger, but still processed at a faster speed. Â \*\* When csv files are open in MS Excel, functions and graphs can be made but they are not saved unless the file is converted to xlsx
:::

For instance, using R, exporting data (115,112 x 179 dimension) in either csv or xlsx format to a OneDrive folder and a Box folder consumed the following time (s):

|          |  CSV  | XSLX  |
|----------|:-----:|:-----:|
| OneDrive | 12.82 | 26.40 |
| Box      | 16.03 | 30.52 |
